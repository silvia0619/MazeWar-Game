/*
 * The "Maze War" game protocol.
 *
 * This header file specifies the format of communication between the
 * Maze War server and its clients.  We will use the term "packet" to refer
 * to a single message sent at the protocol level.  A full-duplex,
 * stream-based (i.e. TCP) connection is used between a client and the
 * server.  Communication is effected by the client and server sending
 * "packets" to each other over this connection.  Each packet consists
 * of a fixed-length header, with fields in network byte order,
 * followed by an optional payload whose length is specified in the header.
 *
 * The following are the packet types in the protocol:
 *
 * Client-to-server requests:
 *   LOGIN:   Log a user into the game
 *            (sends user name, desired avatar/UID)
 *   MOVE:    Move within the maze (possibilities: forward, back)
 *   TURN:    Rotate the direction of gaze (possibilities: left, right)
 *   FIRE:    Fire laser
 *   REFRESH: Ask for the view to be refreshed
 *   SEND:    Send a chat message
 *
 *
 * Server-to-client responses:
 *   READY:   Sent in response to a successful login
 *   INUSE:   Avatar/UID is in use -- login unsuccessful
 *   CLEAR:   Clear all objects from the current view
 *   SHOW:    Show an object in the view
 *            (contains object, direction, distance)
 *   ALERT:   Alert the user to an event that has occurred
 *   SCORE:   Update the scoreboard
 *            (contains user, avatar, score)
 *   CHAT:    Chat message from another user
