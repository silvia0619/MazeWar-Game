 * A "maze" is a rectangular array of cells, each element of which can be blank
 * or contain a single object.  Objects are either player avatars or solid objects;
 * i.e. walls.  Though the code is intended to run with mazes that are arbitrarily
 * populated, the scheme for representing rendering views is more or less based on
 * the assumption that mazes consist of "corridors", which are one unit in width
 * with walls on each side, connected by "doors", which are gaps in the walls.
 * It is not clear how well the display will appear if a maze contains open spaces
 * that are larger than one unit in width.

/*
 * A "view" represents what can be seen in the maze looking from a particular
 * position, gazing in a particular direction.  A view is represented as a
 * Dx3 array, where the parameter D is the "depth" of the view and it
 * corresponds to the distance from the viewer location.  A view is calculated
 * for a particular location simply by starting with that location and extracting
 * the Dx3 "patch" of the maze contents in a particular gaze direction, as suggested
 * by the following diagram, which represents a view of depth 10 seen by player X,
 * in which the player sees a solid corridor wall (*) on the left, a corridor
 * wall (%) with two doors on the right, a solid wall (@) at the end of the
 * corridor, and the avatar A of another player halfway down the corridor.
 *
 *     0123456789
 *   0 *********@
 *   1 X    A   @   --> Direction of gaze
 *   2 %%% %%% %@
 *
 * In accessing a view, the first subscript corresponds to the distance from the
 * origin of the view (which is at [0][1]).  The second subscript has the
 * following meaning:
 *   0 left wall -  The value represents a feature of the left-hand wall of
 *                  the corridor defined by the direction of gaze.  The possible
 *                  features are either solid wall or door.
 *   1 corridor -   The value represents an object in the corridor defined
 *                  by the direction of gaze.  Objects can be avatars of players
 *                  or a wall at the end of the corridor.
 *   2 right wall - The value represents a feature of the right-hand wall of
 *                  the corridor defined by the direction of gaze.  The possible
 *		    features are either solid wall or door.
 *
 * When a view is calculated for a certain position and direction of gaze, the
 * depth of the returned view might not be the maximum possible depth.  This will
 * occur, for example, if the boundary of the maze is encountered at a distance
 * from the origin location that is less than the maximum view depth.
 *
 * The following macros should be used when accessing a view.
