 *
 * You will have to give a complete structure definition in player.c.
 * The precise contents are up to you.  Be sure that all the operations
 * that might be called concurrently are thread-safe.  Note that, due to
 * the pattern of calls made between the maze module and the player module,
 * it is necessary that any mutex used to protect a PLAYER object
 * have the PTHREAD_MUTEX_RECURSIVE attribute set.  This makes the mutex
 * recursive, which means that it can be locked again by a thread that
 * already holds the lock, without a deadlock occurring.  The reason
 * PLAYER objects have to have recursive mutexes is because functions on
 * PLAYER objects may result in calls on the maze, and these in turn may
 * result in an "up call" to player_update_view() to update the player's view.
 * Unless a recursive mutex is used, such an up call will deadlock when
 * the attempt is made to reaquire the PLAYER mutex that is already held.

 * threads can safely call this function to send to the client, and these

 * state of the maze results from the actions of one player, then that
 * then that player's thread will attempt to update the views of all players.
 * Since this can happen concurrently, we need to synchronize access to
 * the network connection to that client.

 * object passed, for the duration of the call.  Since PLAYER mutexes are
 * recursive, it is OK for a thread to call this function while holding
